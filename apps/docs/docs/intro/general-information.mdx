## What is Softkit?

Softkit is an opinionated less-code framework built upon the foundation of [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/), meticulously designed to expedite the development of robust and dependable software solutions while significantly accelerating the development process and steadfastly adhering to industry best practices.

You can think about Softkit as your core team of experienced developers, that already did a lot of work for you.
Many companies don't have a core team at all, and they have to spend a lot of time and money on things that are not related directly to the revenue generation process.
It's not that easy to dedicate a core team as well, because it people that cares about general architecture, best practices, and standards, must be highly experienced and so expensive (_and they don't work on business logic_).
Usually only big companies (_1000+ employees_) can afford it.
