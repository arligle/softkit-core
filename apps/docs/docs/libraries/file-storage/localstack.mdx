# Testing with LocalStack

---

LocalStack provides a fully functional local AWS cloud stack for testing. It's a great tool for developing cloud applications without incurring costs or network latency associated with using real AWS instances.

## Setting Up LocalStack

Use the [`@softkit/test-utils`](/libraries/test-utils/getting-started) module to integrate LocalStack into your testing environment.

### Example Test Configuration

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    S3FileStorageModule.forRoot({
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: 'test',
        secretAccessKey: 'test',
      },
      forcePathStyle: true,
      endpoint: \`http://localhost:\${process.env['TEST_LOCALSTACK_MAIN_PORT']}\`,
      region: 'us-west-1',
    }),
  ],
})
export class FileUploadAppModule {}
```

## Understanding `startLocalstack`

### What is `startLocalstack`?

`startLocalstack` is a function provided by the [`@softkit/test-utils`](/libraries/test-utils/getting-started) library, designed to streamline the setup and management of a LocalStack container. LocalStack emulates AWS cloud services in a local environment, allowing developers to test applications without needing actual AWS infrastructure.

### Benefits of Using `startLocalstack`

- **Efficiency**: Quickly sets up a LocalStack container using `GenericContainer` from the ['testcontainers'](/libraries/test-utils/test-containers) library.
- **Flexibility**: Allows custom configurations for different AWS services.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that tests run in an environment that closely resembles production.

### Practical Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to use [`startLocalstack`](/libraries/test-utils/features#local-aws-testing-with-startlocalstack) in your testing setup:

```typescript
import { startLocalstack } from '@softkit/test-utils';

async function setupTestEnvironment() {
  const localstack = await startLocalstack();
  // LocalStack is now running with your specified configurations
  // Continue with your test setup
}
```

With `startLocalstack`, you can confidently test your applications, knowing they will interact with AWS services as they would in a real-world scenario.
