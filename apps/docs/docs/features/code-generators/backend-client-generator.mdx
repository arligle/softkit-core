## How to use it




## Why is it only for backend?

It has an automatic NestJS module generation and so ideally should be consumed by a NestJS application.

It has a dependency on [ClsService](/features/cls-service) for automatic user token and request id propagation for tracing and convenience.

Also it has a super convenient feature to [proxy errors](/features/backend-http-client) from your microservice to the client application.
